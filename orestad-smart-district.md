## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

Ørestad is a purpose-built smart district in Copenhagen, Denmark, developed since the mid-1990s as part of the city’s long-term strategy for sustainable urban growth. Located on the island of Amager, the district spans about 3.1 square kilometers and is planned around high-density development, contrasting with the surrounding open commons. Ørestad includes four main zones and combines compact housing, smart mobility, and modern architecture with digital infrastructure. While detailed features like automated metro systems and innovation hubs define its identity, the district more broadly reflects Copenhagen’s vision to accommodate population growth, attract investment, and support major infrastructure. Though widely recognized as a successful model of smart city planning, Ørestad has also raised concerns about social inclusivity and long-term affordability.


## Goals and Aspirations

<!-- What is the project trying to achieve? Identify 3-5 high-level goals that define the entire project.Replace the placeholder title with a succinct name for the goal. -->

**Goal 1. Develop a compact and sustainable city district**.  Ørestad was planned to support Copenhagen’s long-term growth by creating a high-density neighborhood that combines homes, offices, and public services in one place. This helps reduce urban sprawl and supports more efficient land use and infrastructure. The goal is to grow without expanding outward.

**Goal 2. Make public transport the backbone of the district**. The project puts smart mobility at the center of its design, especially through the driverless metro system. Ørestad was built to reduce car use and promote public and green transportation. People can easily move around the city and to other regions without needing a car.

**Goal 3. Attract business, talent, and innovation**. The district is meant to become a place where companies, researchers, and institutions can work together. By developing modern offices, cultural centers, and tech infrastructure, Ørestad helps Copenhagen grow as an international business and innovation hub.

**Goal 4. Create an inclusive and livable community**. The project aims to create a vibrant, inclusive community that offers diverse housing options, public spaces, and amenities. By focusing on social sustainability, Ørestad endeavors to provide a high quality of life for its residents while promoting social cohesion.

## Key Characteristics

<!--  How is the project organized into specific activities that advance these goals? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities in digital master plans (development, engagement, implementation). For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of innovation hubs?
-->

**Characteristic 1. Mixed-use urban structure**.  Ørestad was designed as a dense, multifunctional district where residential, commercial, cultural, and educational facilities are closely integrated. Ørestad Nord, for instance, brings together media institutions, housing, and education, creating a dynamic, all-day urban environment. This mix of uses supports urban vitality and encourages diverse social interaction.

**Characteristic 2. Presence of knowledge and research institutions**. The district is home to the IT University of Copenhagen and Ørestad Gymnasium (high school), helping concentrate tech-focused education and talent. Its proximity to other research and innovation centers in Copenhagen further positions it as a knowledge hub.

**Characteristic 3.  High physical and digital connectivity**.  With access to the M1 metro line, national rail, and the E20 highway, Ørestad offers some of the best transport connectivity in the region—linking directly to the airport and Malmö, Sweden. The district also provides high-speed digital infrastructure that supports smart city functions and business operations.

**Characteristic 4.  Innovation ecosystem and collaborative platforms**.  Through initiatives like Ørestad Innovation City Copenhagen (OICC), the district fosters collaboration between government, business, and academia. It serves as a "living lab" for piloting smart energy, mobility, and governance solutions at city scale.

**Characteristic 5.  Sustainability as a core design principle**.  Ørestad integrates green mobility, energy-efficient buildings, and access to nature. Projects like UN17 Village embed all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals into housing and community design—making sustainability part of everyday life.
